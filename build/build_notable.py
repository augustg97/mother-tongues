"""build_notable.py — the wall labels, keyed by NAME and resolved to glottocodes by machine.

Seven of the first thirty labels sat on the wrong language because I wrote eight-character
glottocodes from memory: `nucl1301` is Turkish, not Standard Arabic. The fix is not to be
more careful. It is to never write a glottocode by hand again — label the language by the
name Glottolog calls it, resolve the code here, and fail loudly on anything ambiguous.

Each entry is (Glottolog name, image search terms, label). The name must match Glottolog
exactly; if it does not, or matches more than one language, this refuses to guess.

 ("Hittite", "Hittite cuneiform tablet Bogazkoy",
  "The first Indo-European language anyone wrote down. Hittite was the language of a Bronze "
  "Age empire in Anatolia, kept on clay tablets at Hattusa and lost for three thousand years "
  "until the archive was dug up in 1906 and read by Bedřich Hrozný in 1915. Its survival "
  "rewrote the family tree: Hittite keeps consonants the other branches had already lost, "
  "which is why Anatolian is now placed as the first branch to leave."),
 ("Sanskrit", "Rigveda manuscript",
  "The language of the Rigveda, composed orally around 1500–1200 BCE and carried by memory "
  "with such precision that the text was fixed for a millennium before it was written. "
  "Pāṇini's grammar of the fourth century BCE describes it in about four thousand rules — the "
  "most rigorous description of any language until the twentieth century."),
 ("Ionic-Attic Ancient Greek", "Homer Iliad papyrus",
  "Homer, Sappho, Plato, Thucydides. Greek was written first in Linear B for palace accounts, "
  "then in an alphabet borrowed from Phoenician and improved by giving the vowels their own "
  "letters — the change that made a fully phonemic script possible."),
 ("Latin", "Roman inscription Latin marble Trajan",
  "A minor dialect of Latium that followed the Roman army and outlived the empire twice: as "
  "the language of the western church for a thousand years, and as the ancestor of "
  "Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, French, Italian and Romanian — all of which are Latin still "
  "being spoken."),
 ("Gothic", "Codex Argenteus",
  "The earliest substantial Germanic text: a fourth-century Bible translation by Wulfila, who "
  "invented an alphabet for it. The Codex Argenteus is written in silver and gold on purple "
  "vellum. Gothic died out, but because it was written three centuries before Old English it "
  "is the closest thing we have to the Germanic parent."),
 ("Old English (ca. 450-1100)", "Beowulf manuscript Cotton Vitellius",
  "The language of Beowulf and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle — inflected, and almost entirely "
  "Germanic in vocabulary. Beowulf survives in a single copy that was scorched in a library "
  "fire in 1731 and is still crumbling at the edges."),
 ("Church Slavic", "Codex Zographensis Old Church Slavonic",
  "Devised in the ninth century by Cyril and Methodius so that Slavs could hear the liturgy "
  "in a language they understood. It is the oldest recorded Slavic language, and the "
  "alphabets that came from that mission — Glagolitic, then Cyrillic — are still in use "
  "across a quarter of Europe."),
 ("Avestan", "Avesta manuscript",
  "The language of the Gathas, hymns attributed to Zarathustra and among the oldest "
  "Indo-Iranian poetry that survives. It was preserved liturgically for centuries by priests "
  "who no longer spoke it."),
 ("Old Persian (ca. 600-400 B.C.)", "Behistun inscription",
  "The language of Darius and Xerxes, cut into a cliff at Behistun in three languages at "
  "once. That trilingual inscription was the key that opened Mesopotamian cuneiform, doing "
  "for Akkadian what the Rosetta Stone did for Egyptian."),
 ("Tokharian A", "Tocharian manuscript fragment",
  "Found in Buddhist manuscripts in the Tarim Basin — the easternmost Indo-European branch, "
  "four thousand kilometres from any other, and unexpectedly a centum language like Latin "
  "and Celtic rather than a satem one like its Iranian neighbours. Nobody has spoken it "
  "since roughly the ninth century."),
 ("Classical-Middle Armenian", "Armenian manuscript Matenadaran",
  "Given its own alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots around 405 CE specifically so that scripture "
  "could be translated. Armenian is a branch of Indo-European entirely on its own, and the "
  "manuscripts at the Matenadaran run unbroken from the fifth century."),
 ("Early Irish", "Book of Kells folio",
  "Old Irish has the earliest vernacular literature in western Europe after Latin and Greek, "
  "and one of the most complex verbal systems in the family. Its scribes also drew: the Book "
  "of Kells was made by people who spoke it."),
 ("Lithuanian", "Mazvydas Catechism 1547",
  "Often called the most conservative living Indo-European language — it kept case endings "
  "and pitch accent that Sanskrit had already lost. The first printed Lithuanian book is "
  "Martynas Mažvydas's catechism of 1547; under the Tsarist press ban of 1864–1904 books "
  "were smuggled in by knygnešiai, book-carriers."),
 ("Welsh", "Book of Aneirin Welsh manuscript",
  "One of the oldest continuously spoken languages in Britain, with a poetic tradition "
  "reaching back to the sixth century. Nearly extinguished by the nineteenth-century schools, "
  "it is now one of the clearest cases of a minority language deliberately turned around."),
 ("Gheg Albanian", "Meshari Gjon Buzuku",
  "A branch with no close relatives. The first substantial book is Gjon Buzuku's Meshari of "
  "1555; the language's isolation and heavy borrowing from Latin, Greek and Slavic made its "
  "position in the family hard to establish for a century."),
 ("Old Norse", "Codex Regius Poetic Edda",
  "The language of the sagas and the Eddas, and of the people who reached Vinland. Its "
  "descendants split sharply: Icelandic changed so little that modern readers manage the "
  "sagas, while Danish moved furthest of all."),
 ("Icelandic", "Icelandic saga manuscript Flateyjarbok",
  "The most conservative living Germanic language, kept close to Old Norse by isolation and "
  "by deliberate purism — new things get new compounds from native roots rather than "
  "loanwords: a computer is a tölva, a number-prophetess."),
 ("Old High German (ca. 750-1050)", "Hildebrandslied manuscript",
  "The ancestor of German, recorded from the eighth century and marked off from its Germanic "
  "cousins by the High German consonant shift, which turned p, t, k into pf, ts and ch. It is "
  "the change that separates Wasser from water."),
 ("Old French (842-ca. 1400)", "Chanson de Roland manuscript Oxford",
  "The language of the Chanson de Roland and of the Normans who took it to England, where it "
  "became the source of a third of the English vocabulary. It kept a two-case system that "
  "Modern French has entirely lost."),
 ("Old Saxon", "Heliand manuscript",
  "The Heliand retells the gospel as Germanic heroic verse, with Christ as a liege-lord and "
  "the apostles as his war-band — a translation not just of language but of the whole social "
  "world its hearers lived in."),
 ("Iron Ossetian", "Ossetian Nart sagas",
  "The last survivor of the Scythian-Sarmatian languages of the steppe, stranded in the "
  "Caucasus. Its Nart sagas preserve motifs that appear across the Iranian world, and Georges "
  "Dumézil used it as evidence for the shape of Indo-European myth."),
 ("Modern Greek", "Greek manuscript Byzantine gospel",
  "The only branch of Indo-European with a continuous written record from the Bronze Age to "
  "the present. A speaker today can make partial sense of a text written twenty-five "
  "centuries ago, which is true of no other living European language."),
 ("Eastern Yiddish", "Yiddish printed book Bovo-Bukh",
  "A Germanic language written in the Hebrew alphabet, carrying Hebrew, Aramaic and Slavic "
  "vocabulary — the everyday tongue of Ashkenazi Europe, and the language of most of the "
  "people murdered in the Holocaust. It survives in Hasidic communities and in a scattering "
  "of secular revival."),
 ("Tavringer Romani", "Romani people historical illustration",
  "An Indo-Aryan language carried out of northern India roughly a thousand years ago and "
  "spoken across Europe ever since, absorbing vocabulary from every country it passed "
  "through. Its Indian origin was established in the eighteenth century purely by comparing "
  "words."),
 ("Bengali", "Bengali manuscript Charyapada",
  "The language of Tagore and of the only country founded on a language movement: the "
  "students shot in Dhaka in 1952 for demanding Bengali are commemorated by UNESCO's "
  "International Mother Language Day."),
 ("Nepali", "Nepali manuscript Devanagari",
  "An Indo-Aryan language that spread across the Himalaya as an administrative tongue, now "
  "the shared second language of dozens of Tibeto-Burman communities that surround it."),
 ("Sinhala", "Sinhala inscription Sri Lanka",
  "Indo-Aryan, carried to Sri Lanka more than two thousand years ago and separated from its "
  "relatives ever since — a northern language with a southern island's history, written in a "
  "rounded script shaped by centuries of writing on palm leaves."),
 ("Northern Pashto", "Pashto manuscript Khushal Khan Khattak",
  "An Eastern Iranian language of the Afghan highlands with a written tradition from the "
  "sixteenth century, and a phonology conservative enough to preserve consonant clusters "
  "Persian has long simplified."),
 ("Marathi", "Marathi Modi script manuscript",
  "One of the oldest attested modern Indo-Aryan languages, written for centuries in the "
  "cursive Modi script before Devanagari displaced it, and the language of the Bhakti poets "
  "Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram."),
 ("Latvian", "Latvian dainas folk song manuscript",
  "Latvian and Lithuanian are the only Baltic languages left. Latvian's dainas — hundreds of "
  "thousands of four-line folk songs collected in the nineteenth century — are among the "
  "largest bodies of oral poetry ever written down."),
 ("Breton", "Breton manuscript Barzaz Breiz",
  "Celtic, but carried to France from Britain rather than surviving there, which makes it the "
  "only Celtic language on the continent. It has been in steep decline for a century and its "
  "speakers are mostly old."),
 ("Scottish Gaelic", "Book of the Dean of Lismore",
  "Brought from Ireland, once spoken across most of Scotland, and pushed to the western "
  "seaboard by the Clearances and by schooling that punished it. Its literature includes some "
  "of the finest verse in any Celtic language."),
 ("Catalan", "Catalan manuscript Ramon Llull",
  "Not a dialect of Spanish but a separate Romance language with its own medieval literature, "
  "banned from public life under Franco and now spoken by millions again."),
 ("Portuguese", "Cantigas de Santa Maria manuscript",
  "The Romance language that travelled furthest: from a corner of Iberia to Brazil, Angola, "
  "Mozambique, Goa and Macau. Its earliest literature is Galician-Portuguese lyric poetry."),
 ("Romanian", "Romanian old book Coresi",
  "Latin that survived east of the Adriatic, surrounded by Slavic for a thousand years and "
  "written in Cyrillic until the nineteenth century. It keeps a case system the western "
  "Romance languages lost."),
 ("Standard Arabic", "Quran manuscript Kufic",
  "The classical language of the Qur'an, and the shared written register of two dozen "
  "countries, while the spoken varieties of Morocco and Iraq are as far apart as Portuguese "
  "and Romanian."),
 ("Sumerian", "Sumerian cuneiform tablet",
  "A language isolate with no known relatives, and the first language on Earth to be written. "
  "Sumerian scribes invented cuneiform for accounting around 3300 BCE and it became a "
  "literature — Gilgamesh among it. It was still taught in schools long after nobody spoke it."),
 ("Akkadian", "Code of Hammurabi stele",
  "The Semitic language of Babylon and Assyria, written in borrowed Sumerian cuneiform. For "
  "centuries it was the diplomatic language of the whole Near East: the Amarna letters show "
  "an Egyptian pharaoh corresponding with Canaanite vassals in Akkadian."),
 ("Egyptian (Ancient)", "Egyptian hieroglyphs Book of the Dead",
  "Attested continuously for more than four thousand years, longer than any other language — "
  "from Old Kingdom hieroglyphs to Coptic, still used liturgically today. Champollion read it "
  "in 1822 with the Rosetta Stone."),
 ("Yucatec Maya", "Maya codex Dresden",
  "The Maya wrote the only fully developed writing system of the pre-Columbian Americas, "
  "combining syllabic signs with logograms; Yucatec is its closest living descendant. Almost "
  "all the books were burned in the sixteenth century and four codices survive."),
 ("Classical Nahuatl", "Florentine Codex Nahuatl",
  "The language of the Mexica and the lingua franca of central Mexico, written after the "
  "conquest in Latin letters by Nahua scribes — including the Florentine Codex, a twelve-book "
  "encyclopedia of their own world compiled in their own language."),
 ("Old Chinese", "Oracle bone script Shang",
  "The oracle bones of the Shang, inscribed with questions put to ancestors and cracked with "
  "heat, are the earliest Chinese writing and the direct ancestor of the characters in use "
  "today — the longest continuously used writing system in the world."),
 ("Korean", "Hunminjeongeum Haerye",
  "Korean was written with Chinese characters until 1443, when King Sejong's scholars designed "
  "hangul, an alphabet whose consonant shapes diagram the tongue and lips that make them. It "
  "is the only major writing system whose invention, date and rationale are all documented."),
 ("Old Japanese", "Kojiki manuscript",
  "Old Japanese survives in the Kojiki and the Man'yōshū, written with Chinese characters used "
  "for their sound. It preserves eight vowel distinctions that later Japanese collapsed to "
  "five — visible only because the scribes were consistent."),
 ("Finnish", "Kalevala manuscript Lonnrot",
  "Finnish spelling is close to one letter per sound, and its fifteen cases do the work "
  "prepositions do elsewhere. Elias Lönnrot assembled the Kalevala in the 1830s from oral "
  "poetry collected in Karelia; it gave the language a national epic and gave Tolkien the "
  "sound of Quenya."),
 ("Basque", "Basque inscription Euskara old book",
  "The last pre-Indo-European language of western Europe, spoken across the western Pyrenees "
  "and related to nothing else on Earth. It was already there when Latin arrived, survived "
  "Rome, and survived a twentieth-century ban on its public use."),
 ("Hindi", "Devanagari manuscript Hindi",
  "The Rigveda's distant descendant and the Mughal court's inheritance both feed Hindi-Urdu: "
  "one spoken language written in two scripts, whose separation into two named languages was "
  "an act of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."),
 ("Mandarin Chinese", "Chinese calligraphy Lanting Xu",
  "More first-language speakers than any other language. Its writing is not an alphabet, so a "
  "text can be read aloud in Cantonese or Hokkien by someone who could not hold a "
  "conversation with the writer."),
 # ---- pass 2: Indo-European depth ------------------------------------------------------
 ("Middle English", "Canterbury Tales Ellesmere manuscript",
  "English after the Norman conquest had shed most of its endings and taken on a French "
  "vocabulary for law, food and rule. Chaucer wrote in it deliberately, when the court still "
  "used French, and in doing so made a literary language out of a servants' one."),
 ("Old Prussian", "Elbing vocabulary Old Prussian",
  "The third Baltic language, and the only one that died: extinct by about 1700 after German "
  "settlement and the Teutonic Order. It survives in three catechisms and a wordlist, which "
  "is enough to show it was more conservative than either Lithuanian or Latvian."),
 ("Oscan", "Oscan inscription Tabula Bantina",
  "Italic, but not Latin — the language of the Samnites who fought Rome for a century. It was "
  "written right to left in its own alphabet, and the graffiti at Pompeii show people still "
  "using it when Vesuvius buried the town."),
 ("Umbrian", "Iguvine Tablets",
  "Known almost entirely from the seven bronze Iguvine Tablets, a priesthood's ritual manual "
  "from Gubbio: which animals to sacrifice, which words to say, which direction to face. It "
  "is the fullest religious text in any Italic language other than Latin."),
 ("Sogdian", "Sogdian Ancient Letters manuscript",
  "The trade language of the Silk Road for a thousand years, carried by merchants from "
  "Samarkand as far as Chang'an. The Ancient Letters, abandoned in a watchtower west of "
  "Dunhuang around 313 CE, include a woman writing furiously to the husband who stranded her."),
 ("Bactrian", "Bactrian inscription Rabatak",
  "The only Iranian language ever written in Greek letters, a legacy of Alexander. The "
  "Rabatak inscription, found in 1993, rewrote the genealogy of the Kushan kings."),
 ("Khotanese", "Khotanese manuscript Dunhuang",
  "An Eastern Iranian language of the Tarim oases, written in Brahmi and used for Buddhist "
  "texts. Most of what survives came out of the sealed library cave at Dunhuang."),
 ("Kashmiri", "Sharada script manuscript Kashmir",
  "Dardic, at the northwestern edge of Indo-Aryan, with a word order unlike any of its "
  "neighbours — it puts the verb second, like German. It was written in Sharada, then "
  "Devanagari, then Perso-Arabic, as its writers changed religion and rulers."),
 ("Upper Sorbian", "Sorbian book Lusatia",
  "A West Slavic language spoken in Lusatia inside Germany, which has kept the dual number "
  "that almost every other Slavic language dropped — separate forms for two things as against "
  "three or more."),
 ("Cornish", "Cornish Ordinalia manuscript",
  "Declared dead in 1777 with the death of Dolly Pentreath, and revived in the twentieth "
  "century from medieval miracle plays and a handful of prose. There are children speaking it "
  "again, which is rarer than extinction."),
 ("Manx", "Manx Bible Manx Gaelic book",
  "Its last native speaker, Ned Maddrell, died in 1974 — and UNESCO reclassified it from "
  "extinct to critically endangered in 2009, because the revival had produced new speakers, "
  "including children schooled in it."),
 ("Faroese", "Faroese manuscript Foroyar",
  "Left with no written standard for four hundred years while Danish did all the writing; "
  "V. U. Hammershaimb built one in 1846 on etymological principles, so Faroese spelling shows "
  "its Old Norse ancestry more clearly than it shows its own pronunciation."),
 ("Western Frisian", "Frisian manuscript Fryslan",
  "The closest living relative of English — the two were still mutually intelligible when the "
  "Angles and Saxons left the North Sea coast. Frisian kept the sounds English lost: tsiis "
  "and cheese, tsjerke and church."),
 ("Occitan", "Troubadour manuscript chansonnier",
  "The language of the troubadours, who invented courtly love poetry and exported it to "
  "Italy, Catalonia and Germany. It was the prestige literary language of Europe before "
  "French was, and is now spoken mostly by the old."),
 ("Galician", "Cantigas de Santa Maria Galician manuscript",
  "Portuguese and Galician were one language until politics separated them: the medieval "
  "lyric of the whole peninsula was written in Galician-Portuguese, including by a Castilian "
  "king who wrote his hymns in it rather than his own tongue."),
 ("Logudorese Sardinian", "Sardinian charter Carte Volgari",
  "The most conservative Romance language: it kept the Latin hard c before front vowels, so "
  "kentu where Italian has cento. Its earliest documents are eleventh-century charters, older "
  "than almost any other Romance vernacular text."),
 ("Venetian", "Venetian manuscript Venice",
  "Not a dialect of Italian but a separate Romance language, and the language of a maritime "
  "republic that ran the eastern Mediterranean for five hundred years — which is why Venetian "
  "words turn up in Greek, Turkish and Croatian harbours."),
 ("Slovenian", "Freising manuscripts Slovene",
  "The Freising manuscripts of around 1000 CE are the oldest Slavic text in the Latin "
  "alphabet, and the oldest written Slovene. The language keeps the dual, and has an unusual "
  "number of mutually difficult dialects for so small a country."),
 ("Macedonian", "Macedonian manuscript Ohrid",
  "South Slavic, and the language whose separateness from Bulgarian has been argued about for "
  "a century for reasons that are mostly not linguistic. It is one of the few Slavic "
  "languages with a definite article, which it takes from the Balkan sprachbund."),
 ("Sindhi", "Sindhi manuscript Shah Jo Risalo",
  "Indo-Aryan, with a set of implosive consonants that almost no other Indo-European language "
  "has. Shah Abdul Latif's Risalo is sung rather than read, and the singing has kept the "
  "eighteenth-century text alive."),
 ("Gujarati", "Gujarati manuscript Jain",
  "The language Gandhi wrote his autobiography in, and the vehicle of a large Jain manuscript "
  "tradition. Its script dropped the horizontal bar that Devanagari runs across the top of "
  "every word, which is why the two look so different at a glance."),
 ("Odia", "Odia palm leaf manuscript",
  "Its rounded letters are a direct consequence of its writing surface: straight lines split "
  "a palm leaf along the grain, so the scribes curved everything. Odia has a literary record "
  "reaching back to the tenth century."),
 ("Assamese", "Assamese manuscript sanchipat",
  "Written on sanchipat, bark of the agar tree, in a script it shares with Bengali but with "
  "its own letters. Its early literature is largely the devotional work of Sankardev, who "
  "wrote plays to be performed in village prayer halls."),
 ("Northern Kurdish", "Kurdish manuscript Mem u Zin",
  "Kurdish is written in three alphabets across four countries and was banned outright in "
  "Turkey until 1991. Ehmedê Xanî's Mem û Zîn of 1692 is its national epic and argues, inside "
  "the poem, that Kurdish deserves to be a written language."),
